Approach enemy, time frame to attack, if missed the enemy walks past.
If you attack, it builds that enemy's anger bar.
To defuse the situation you can yell "It's a prank" to calm him down.
If you calm him down enough he walks away. You'll have to mash fast enough as his anger will start rising when you attack him. The more you attack him the faster his bar raises.
If you anger him too much he'll beat you up and the level is over.
